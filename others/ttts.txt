[Teen Titans Theme Song]

[Verse 1]
When there's trouble, you know who to call (Teen Titans!)
From their tower, they can see it all (Teen Titans!)
When there's evil on the attack
You can rest knowing they got your back
'Cause when the world needs heroes on patrol
Teen Titans, go!

[Verse 2]
With their super powers, they unite (Teen Titans!)
Never met a villain that they liked (Teen Titans!)
They got the bad guys on the run
They never stop 'til the job gets done
'Cause when the world is losing all control
Teen Titans, go!
Teen Titans, go!

[Bridge]
If your heart is black, you better watch out
You cannot escape the team
When they catch you, there won't be any doubt
You've been beaten by the teens
Beaten by the teens

T-e-e-n! T-i-t-a-n-s! Teen Titans! Let's go!
T-e-e-n! T-i-t-a-n-s! Teen Titans! Let's go!
T-e-e-n! T-i-t-a-n-s! Teen Titans! Let's go!
T-e-e-n! T-i-t-a-n-s! Teen Titans! Let's go!

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
When there's trouble, you know who to call (Teen Titans!)
From their tower, they can see it all (Teen Titans!)
When there's evil on the attack
You can rest knowing they got your back
'Cause when the world needs heroes on patrol
Teen Titans, go!
Teen Titans, go!

[Outro]
One, two, three, four, go!
Teen Titans!
